# Unified Shell Module Builder Handoff - 2026-06-27

## Current Project Understanding

- Repository root: `/Users/noixzy.macbookpro/Downloads/noixzy_generative_lab`
- Unified Shell entry: `unified_shell.html`
- Unified Shell loads modules from `modules.manifest.json` and uses `homeOrder` inside `unified_shell.html` for visible ordering.
- Generated modules are authored in `build_lab.js` and emitted as one HTML file per module directory by running `node build_lab.js`.
- Home entries are maintained in `home/home.html`.
- Thumbnail assets live in `home/thumbs/`.
- Do not work on `workspace/module_escrow_20260627` for Unified Shell continuation.
- Do not redesign the Unified Shell chrome; this pass only added modules and integration references.

Known nonfatal smoke-test note:

- Console reported 404s during early module loads while new thumbnails were still being captured. After thumbnail generation, the final shell request loaded the new thumbnails with `200` responses. The module canvases rendered nonblank and no fatal JS errors were reported by the smoke script.

## Known Issues

- `modules.manifest.json` still references `fold/noixzy_fold.html`, but only `_archive/fold` was found. This appears pre-existing and was not changed in this Unified Shell batch.
- Because generated modules are rebuilt from `build_lab.js`, running `node build_lab.js` can modify many generated HTML files beyond the ten new modules. Treat `build_lab.js` as the source of truth for generated modules.
- Existing repo has unrelated dirty/untracked files from earlier work. Do not revert them without explicit user instruction.

## Integration Notes

- New modules are enabled in shell through `modules.manifest.json` with `enabledInShell: true`.
- New module ordering is controlled by the added ids in `unified_shell.html` `homeOrder`.
- New thumbnails were captured by Playwright at `1280x720` and saved directly to `home/thumbs/`.
- Do not add a `form` UI group to generated modules; current generated convention uses `system`, `extrude`, `material`, `frame`, `look`, and `motion`.
- Continue adding modules through `build_lab.js` unless intentionally creating a hand-authored module.

## Pending TODO Items

- Fix or intentionally retire the stale `fold/noixzy_fold.html` manifest entry.
- Consider a later pass to regenerate all home thumbnails for visual consistency.
- Add a lightweight automated smoke script to the repo if the user wants repeatable module validation.
- Continue adding production-ready generated modules in batches, avoiding concepts already covered by the current list.

## Recommended Implementation Order

1. Resolve stale `fold` manifest reference or move the archived module back into the expected path if appropriate.
2. Add the next batch of generated modules to `build_lab.js`.
3. Run `node --check build_lab.js`.
4. Run `node build_lab.js`.
5. Add module ids to `unified_shell.html` `homeOrder`.
6. Add home records to `home/home.html`.
7. Add manifest records to `modules.manifest.json`.
8. Start a local server and browser-smoke every new module for nonblank canvas output.
9. Capture thumbnails into `home/thumbs/`.
10. Update this handoff or create the next dated agent handoff.

## Suggested Next Steps For Copilot

- Make a compact manifest maintenance patch for the stale `fold` entry.
- Add a small validation script that checks module files, thumbs, shell ordering, and home coverage.
- Keep future generated modules inside `build_lab.js` and avoid direct patching of generated HTML unless debugging a one-off issue.

## Suggested Next Steps For Claude

- Review module concept coverage and propose the next ten unexplored algorithmic art directions.
- Prioritize concepts that add genuinely different geometry systems, not only different palettes.
- Produce short implementation briefs with controls, randomization behavior, and expected visual signatures.

## Suggested Next Steps For Future Codex Sessions

- Continue from `build_lab.js`; append new ids to `ALL_MODULES` and new definitions to `PIECES`.
- Use the ten modules from this pass as examples for geometry-first generated modules with strong parameter interaction.
- Keep the Unified Shell chrome stable.
- Verify with a local HTTP server and Playwright before final response.

## Safe Continuation Points

- Safe to continue adding generated modules immediately after the `woven_lattice_relief` `PIECES` definition in `build_lab.js`.
- Safe to append future shell ids near the new ten ids in `unified_shell.html`.
- Safe to append future home entries near the new ten entries in `home/home.html`.
- Safe to add future manifest entries following the schema used for these ten modules.
